No change needed.\n\n'sales_method': 15000 entries all non-null objects. Should be only 3 categories but are 5. Corrected typos for 'email', and 'em + call'.\n\n'customer_id': 15000 entries all non-null unique objects. No change needed.\n\n'nb_sold': 15000 entries all non-null integers. No change needed.\n\n'revenue': 13926 entires, remainder missing values. I thought about imputing the average price per 'nb_sold', however, the spread between price ranges was too large. Since NA's only accounted for less than 10% of the data, I dropped the missing rows from the data set.\n\n'years_as_customer': all non-null integers. No change needed.\n\n'nb_site_visits': all non-null integers. No change needed\n\n'state': all non-null objects. No change needed\n\n\n##Exploratory Analysis\n\nLooking at total sales by sales method, we can see Email was the most successful with about 7k total sales, followed by Calls at around 5k and last was both at about 2k.\n\n![Figure_1](Figure_1.png)\n\nThe spread of revenue by method shows a slightly different story. Although email still reigned dominant as far as sales went, the Call method did not provide with as much revenue as the email and call combined.\n\n![Figure_2](Figure_2.png)\n\nAlso, if we look at the spread of data by revenue per sale in our boxplot, we see that per sale, the email and call was more lucrative. \n\n![Figure_3](Figure_3.png)\n\nLooking at revenue over time by method, we see that Email started strong but gradually decreased in revenue over time, however, Email and Call combined had increasing revenue over time while Call alone stayed stagnant and even dipped a bit in the end of the timeframe.\n\n![Figure_4](Figure_4.png)\n\nBased on these findings, I would recommend continuing the email method since it takes th least amout of resources and has the most amout of revenue generated and only including the call + email method, since this takes less time than just the Call method and reinforces sales in the long run while the email only method may be slowing in revenue. Also, with half the amount of sales and twice the amount of revenue, the Email + Call method definitely is more lucrative.\n\n\n![Figure_5](Figure_5.png)\n\n![Figure_6](Figure_6.png)\n\n\nOther insights:\n- newer customers tend to produce more revenue as shown in figure 5, so it may be wise to focus on that demographic\n\n- site visits seem resemble a normal curve with the average at 26, meaning site views up to this point seem to generate the most revenue. Could be something else to look into and keep an eye on.\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"562d9d77-2e1e-4523-a28e-1e3b388f930c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"c22f7f5b-2a69-4515-8b29-7b0e94829f11","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## ‚úÖ When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
